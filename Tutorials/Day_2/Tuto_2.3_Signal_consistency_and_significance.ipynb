    "In this tutorial, we find a peak in Virgo as large as the obseved one has an approximately 2% chance of occuring due to the noise alone. Since that is a relatively low probability, we may reject the null hypothesis that the observed peak is due to noise alone. Given the simplifications of this tutorial, we find a result in agreement with the [GW170814 discovery paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09660.pdf) which reported a p-value of 0.3%.\n",

In this case, this method of estimating the significance would only be able to set an upper bound on the p-value of the observed peak. In order to calculate the p-value of a much larger peak, we would either need to use more background data or make additional assumptions about the background distribution. If a gravitational-wave signal is extremely loud, it is challenging to calculate the precise significance of the observed peak, but we can still be confident that the signal is very significant! "
