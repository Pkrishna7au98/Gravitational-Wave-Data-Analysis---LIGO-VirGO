We can view this as filtering the data with the time series equivalent of 1 / PSD. To ensure that we can control the effective length of the filter, we window the time domain equivalent of the PSD to a specific length. This has the effect of losing some information about line behavior in the detector. However, since our signals span a large frequency range, and lines are narrow, this is a negligible effect.\n",
